scarletroad_dedication,SHIP,"The Dedication is a versatile destroyer that uses a Damper Field integrated into the ship's armor to mitigate incoming fire, and powerful flux infusers that can greatly overcharge the ship's weapon systems for a brief moment. It is one of the most ubiquitous Scarlet Road ships, often seen leading the charge in smaller Scarlet fleets and has a reputation for ending battles before they even start.",,,
scarletroad_incorruptible,SHIP,"The Incorruptible often acts as more of a weapons platform than a ship in Scarlet Fleets. The ship is built around a single heavy weapon mount, and is often seen escorting larger ships to provide fire support, as the ship has great difficulty operating independently due to a lack of mobility and defensive options. What it lacks in defenses, however, it more than makes up for in range, containing a Targeting Overclock system that allows the Incorruptible to snipe at enemies from well out of harm's way.",,,
scarletroad_justice,SHIP,"The Justice is an excellent raiding and skirmishing frigate, thanks primarily to its Weaver Boost, which gives it unparalleled speed and maneuverability, in lieu of heavier armor or the shields more commonly seen among the sector. The Justice operates best at point blank range, where it can unleash a barrage of fusion saws, able to decimate unprotected hulls in seconds.",,,
,,,,,
scarletroad_confrontation,WEAPON,"The Confrontation Chaingun is often the point defense weapon of choice for Scarlet ships. Compared to other weapons of its class, it lacks in reliable fire rate, as it takes significant time to reload its magazines. Instead, the Confrontation provides surprisingly high firepower for its size, able to reliably destroy even heavy missiles and fighters in a single barrage.",,,
scarletroad_hearing,WEAPON,"The Hearing is a reliable mid-range gun that fires in 3-round bursts, and is primarily used to apply pressure to enemy shields. In large enough numbers, Hearing Cannons provide enough burst damage to overload ships that are caught off guard.",,,
scarletroad_rebellion,WEAPON,"The Rebellion is an improvement over its smaller cousin, the Protest, providing much improved fire rate, though still lacking in projectile speed. However, the loading system has not kept up with the improved fire-rate, causing the firerate to greatly decline if kept firing for too long. It is best held in reserve until a ship is within close range and lacking shield support, which is where the Rebellion shines most.",,,
scarletroad_tribulation,WEAPON,"The Tribulation is similar in many ways to the Hearing, providing shield pressure and high projectile speed. It boasts a 6-shot burst over the Hearing, and most Scarlet vessels that can mount large weapons will mount at least one Tribulation.",,,
,,,,,
scarletroad_targetingoverclock,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Redirects computing power that would be used to control flux vents into the weapons systems. Provides a significant increase to energy and ballistic weapon range, but prevents flux dissipation while active.",,,
scarletroad_integrateddamper,SHIP_SYSTEM,A toggleable variant of the more ubiquitous damper field. Generates hard flux while active.,,,
scarletroad_momentofcourage,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Induces premature fusion reactions within ballistic weapon ammunition, providing an enormous damage increase and flux cost increase for a brief moment.",,,
scarletroad_weaverboost,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Nanite networks throughout the ship provides a significant boost to top speed and nearly-inertialess maneuverability, but generates hard flux while active.",,,
scarletroad_bladetorrent,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Launches a torrent of Fusion Saws at very short range, dealing high fragmentation damage and generating high flux.",,,

scarletroad,FACTION,"It was not uncommon in the Domain era for colonies to develop self-autonomy, some of which took the bold step of declaring independence from the Domain. Such an act was systemically followed by a severing of the rebel system from the gate network, intent on depriving the rebellious system of the resources needed to sustain the coloiny. In the rarer case that a colony became completely self-sufficient, the domain would send an expedition to re-integrate the system by force. No matter how stubborn the defense, eventually a lone world would fall to the overwhelming might of the domain. The Scarlet system, set 257 lightyears to the galactic northwest of the Persean sector, was slated to become the latest addition to the list of rebellions quelled by the Domain, having miraculously fended off the first assault of Domain Battlegroup XI's vanguard. But fate had other plans in store, as the battle now remembered as the ""Scarlet Miracle"" took place on the eve of the entire gate network falling offline, later precipitating the Collapse of the Domain.  Battlegroup XI left for the Domain core worlds, and the Scarlet System enjoyed decades of relative peace. 

Then came a second, even greater miracle: Engineers from the Scarlet system, after decades of study and research, were able to reverse-engineer parts of the system's dormant gate. Although the old Domain network remained inaccessible, it was clear that this gate could reliably connect to any second gate of Scarlet's choosing. By routinely opening other dormant gates in systems surrounding Scarlet for colonization and later trading fleets, the wayward colony soon became a bustling trade center, and a confederacy of these systems was formed, calling themselves the Scarlet Road.
