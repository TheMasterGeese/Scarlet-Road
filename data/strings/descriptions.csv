scarletroad_dedication,SHIP,"The Dedication is a versatile destroyer that uses a Damper Field integrated into the ship's armor to mitigate incoming fire, and powerful flux infusers that can greatly overcharge the ship's weapon systems for a brief moment. It is one of the most ubiquitous Scarlet Road ships, often seen leading the charge in smaller Scarlet fleets and has a reputation for ending battles before they even start.",,,
scarletroad_incorruptible,SHIP,"The Incorruptible often acts as more of a weapons platform than a ship in Scarlet Fleets. The ship is built around a single heavy weapon mount, and is often seen escorting larger ships to provide fire support, as the ship has great difficulty operating independently due to a lack of mobility and defensive options. What it lacks in defenses, however, it more than makes up for in range, containing a Targeting Overclock system that allows the Incorruptible to snipe at enemies from well out of harm's way.",,,
scarletroad_justice,SHIP,"The Justice is an excellent raiding and skirmishing frigate, thanks primarily to its Weaver Boost, which gives it unparalleled speed and maneuverability, in lieu of heavier armor or the shields more commonly seen among the sector. The Justice operates best at point blank range, where it can unleash a barrage of fusion saws, able to decimate unprotected hulls in seconds.",,,
,,,,,
scarletroad_confrontation,WEAPON,"The Confrontation Chaingun is often the point defense weapon of choice for Scarlet ships. Compared to other weapons of its class, it lacks in reliable fire rate, as it takes significant time to reload its magazines. Instead, the Confrontation provides surprisingly high firepower for its size, able to reliably destroy even heavy missiles and fighters in a single barrage.",,,
scarletroad_hearing,WEAPON,"The Hearing is a reliable mid-range gun that fires in 3-round bursts, and is primarily used to apply pressure to enemy shields. In large enough numbers, Hearing Cannons provide enough burst damage to overload ships that are caught off guard.",,,
scarletroad_rebellion,WEAPON,"The Rebellion is an improvement over its smaller cousin, the Protest, providing much improved fire rate, though still lacking in projectile speed. However, the loading system has not kept up with the improved fire-rate, causing the firerate to greatly decline if kept firing for too long. It is best held in reserve until a ship is within close range and lacking shield support, which is where the Rebellion shines most.",,,
scarletroad_tribulation,WEAPON,"The Tribulation is similar in many ways to the Hearing, providing shield pressure and high projectile speed. It boasts a 6-shot burst over the Hearing, and most Scarlet vessels that can mount large weapons will mount at least one Tribulation.",,,
,,,,,
scarletroad_targetingoverclock,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Redirects computing power that would be used to control flux vents into the weapons systems. Provides a significant increase to energy and ballistic weapon range, but prevents flux dissipation while active.",,,
scarletroad_integrateddamper,SHIP_SYSTEM,A toggleable variant of the more ubiquitous damper field. Generates hard flux while active.,,,
scarletroad_momentofcourage,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Induces premature fusion reactions within ballistic weapon ammunition, providing an enormous damage increase and flux cost increase for a brief moment.",,,
scarletroad_weaverboost,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Nanite networks throughout the ship provides a significant boost to top speed and nearly-inertialess maneuverability, but generates hard flux while active.",,,
scarletroad_bladetorrent,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Launches a torrent of Fusion Saws at very short range, dealing high fragmentation damage and generating high flux.",,,
